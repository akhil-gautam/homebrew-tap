  caveats <<~EOS
    omp-ui is ad-hoc signed and is not Apple-notarized, so the cask removes
    the quarantine flag for it. macOS still may ask you to confirm the first
    launch in System Settings > Privacy & Security.

    omp-ui drives the omp coding agent, which has to be installed separately
    and on your PATH.

  # The app is ad-hoc signed, so Gatekeeper would otherwise refuse to open
  # it. Homebrew's download is what puts the quarantine flag on it.
